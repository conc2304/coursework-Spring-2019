      For this Bauhaus inspired assignment I was extremely torn between Josef Albers, Overlapping
      and Herbert Bayer's, Verdure. As someone who really enjoys minimalism, Albers' Overlapping really grabbed my
      attention.
      To me the piece was all about the layering of contrasting layers that created a sense of movement and depth
      through the use of repetition. I attempted to mimic this effect by creating a set of regimented rectangles
      in a similar, but less random approach, because as a programmer I wanted to be able to generate a constant
      repetition that could scale easily. I kept the rectangles in black and white but made them change color to add to
      the sense
      of depth and to vary the overlapping theme. They are purposefully translucent which lends to the title of Albers'
      piece
      where you can see how each of the rectangles overlaps and the rest. While painting only allows a viewer to explore
      a piece in
      one singular plane, I thought I would break this convention by allowing the user to dive into and explore the
      layers at a more
      intimate level using the <code>orbitControl()</code> function.
    </p>
    <p class="description">The red boxes/spheres are meant to resemble the black bars that run vertically
      in Albers' piece. I thought it would be more interesting if the layers were to move and thus creatinga more
      complex and dynamic
      sense of overlapping. And just because I thought it would be fun, and more engaging for the user, I added some
      slight chaos to the piece. Pressing the <code>a</code> or the <code>i</code> key will engage either auto mode or
      interactive mode. While in interactive mode pressing the <em>OPTION</em> or <em>CONTROL</em> key will add some
      crazier
      movement to the view.

      As a person who find generative art fascinating, I was obviously drawn to Bayer's Verdure. Verdure has a very
      organic flow about it,
      almost as though it is coming alive and moving and flowing inside the walls of the painting. I wanted to capture
      that organic movement
      and use it to juxtapose the rigid and stern look and feel of Albers' Overlapping. I had been in a bookstore in
      Montreal last fall when I
      came across a book called <a
      href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1780674139/ref=oh_aui_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1">Morphing:
      A Guide to Mathematical Transformations for Architects and Designers</a>. I had been trying to get parametric
      equations working in a 3D environment
      with p5js for the longest time, but it was not until this assignment that I found out that my local copy of p5.js
      was very out of date compared
      with the documentation on the p5js website. So once I got a hold of the cdn version I was able to start plotting
      the Z coordinates of the equation.
      Needless to say, this has re-spurred my interest parametric equations now that I know how to make them in 3D!
