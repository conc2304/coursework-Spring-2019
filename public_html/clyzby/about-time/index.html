        For this Bauhaus inspired assignment I was extremely torn between Josef Albers, Overlapping
        and Herbert Bayer's, Verdure. As someone who really enjoys minimalism, Albers' Overlapping really grabbed my
        attention.
        To me the piece was all about the layering of contrasting layers that created a sense of movement and depth
        through the use of repetition. I attempted to mimic this effect by creating a set of regimented rectangles
        in a similar, but less random approach, because as a programmer I wanted to be able to generate a constant
        repetition that could scale easily. I kept the rectangles in black and white but made them change color to add to the sense
        of depth and to vary the overlapping theme. They are purposefully translucent which lends to the title of Albers' piece
        where you can see how each of the rectangles overlaps and the rest. While painting only allows a viewer to explore a piece in
        one singular plane, I thought I would break this convention by allowing the user to dive into and explore the layers at a more
        intimate level using the <code>orbitControl()</code> function.
      </p>
      <p class="description">The red boxes/spheres are meant to resemble the black bars that run vertically
        in Albers' piece. I thought it would be more interesting if the layers were to move and thus creatinga more
        complex and dynamic
        sense of overlapping. And just because I thought it would be fun, and more engaging for the user, I added some
        slight chaos to the piece. Pressing the <code>a</code> or the <code>i</code> key will engage either auto mode or
        interactive mode.  While in interactive mode pressing the <em>OPTION</em> or <em>CONTROL</em> key will add some crazier
        movement to the view.

        As a person who find generative art fascinating, I was obviously drawn to Bayer's Verdure.  Verdure has a very organic flow about it,
        almost as though it is coming alive and moving and flowing inside the walls of the painting.  I wanted to capture that organic movement
        and use it to juxtapose the rigid and stern look and feel of Albers' Overlapping.  I had been in a bookstore in Montreal last fall when I
        came across a book called <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1780674139/ref=oh_aui_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1">Morphing:
        A Guide to Mathematical Transformations for Architects and Designers</a>. I had been trying to get parametric equations working in a 3D environment
        with p5js for the longest time, but it was not until this assignment that I found out that my local copy of p5.js was very out of date compared
        with the documentation on the p5js website.  So once I got a hold of the cdn version I was able to start plotting the Z coordinates of the equation.
        Needless to say, this has re-spurred my interest parametric equations now that I know how to make them in 3D!
